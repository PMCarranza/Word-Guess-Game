# **Word-Guess-Game**

## **aka** 

# **Hangman**

### **Functionality**

This app uses html, css and javascript to create a Word-Guessing-Game.

After instructing the user to "Press any key to get started!", the word to be guessed is displayed as underscores.
The word to be guessed is randomly selected from a list of about twenty (a couple of them is Spanish), each time the game starts.

Key events are used to "listen" for the user input.
Each time the user guesses correctly, the underscore is replaced by the guess in its corresponding spot in the word;
if the guess is incorrect the gallows image is updated.

The user has 10 tries to guess the word *or* "hangs!".

### _**ex:**_
If the word is madonna, it will be displayed like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.

As the user guesses the correct letters, they are revealed:  _a _ o _  _ a.

### **Information displayed as the game is being played**
Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like a z r l).
After the user wins/loses the game asks to "Press any key to get started!".

### **Project Status**
I have decided to not develop this app any further, I might considered changing the colors used but other than that I want this app to remain as is to be reminded of where my road in development started.

Thanks for looking at my app.
I hope you had a chance to play the game.
